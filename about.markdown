<h4><span class="flag-icon flag-icon-ca px-3"></span> Established in Canada with Belgian Roots <span class="flag-icon flag-icon-be px-3"></span></h4> 
Jamie Lee Equestrian was established in 2019 when Jamie Lee and Joël Forest moved onto their agricultural property in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. Situated in the heart of the prairies, the farm is surrounded by a mixture of agricultural land and the Assiniboine Forest. We are located within 1 hour of most of Manitobas circuit horse shows and only 15 minutes directly south of downtown Winnipeg as well as the Winnipeg International airport. Our purpose built state-of-the-art facility offers exceptional care catering to the needs of both horse and rider in a relaxed setting.
