                Jamie Lee Equestrian was established in 2019 by Jamie Lee and JoÃ«l Forest with the intention of breeding <strong>the best Belgian Warmbloods in Canada.</strong> They started their journey when they moved onto their agricultural property in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.
                Situated in the heart of the prairies, the farm is surrounded by a mixture of agricultural land and the Assiniboine Forest.
