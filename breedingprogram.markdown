        We want to work with our clients therefore, flexible payment plans are available. All deposits are refunded in full if the foal is not deemed healthy by a licensed veterinarian.
        An extremely popular and highly successful option is our custom foal program. You can create your very own dream foal with our custom foal option by selecting our mare and breeding her to the stallion of your choice with our approval. Please contact us for more information about our custom foal program.
        Thank you for your interest, we welcome your inquiry and look forward to hearing from you soon!
