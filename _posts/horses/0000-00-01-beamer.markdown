Who loves dapples? This flashy guy is sure to turn heads in the show ring! WKM Beamer is a tall, athletic horse with a modern build and has an ‘in your pocket’ type of personality. Beamer is consistently impressing us with his scope and bravery over fences. He recently started his show career. Beamer is likely more suited for the jumper ring, but with potential for hunters as well. He would be best matched with an experienced junior or amateur rider.

X-rays from 2019 can be made available to serious buyers.
